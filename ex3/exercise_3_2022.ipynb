    "Make sure the notebook produces correct results when ran sequentially starting from the first cell. You can ensure this by clearing all outputs, running all cells, and finally correcting any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get points:\n",
    "1. Submit your answers to the automatically checked Moodle test. \n",
    " - You have 5 tries on the test: the highest obtained score will be taken into account.\n",
    " - For numerical questions the tolerance is $1\\cdot10^{-4}$, so you can round the results e.g. up to 5 decimals.\n",
    "2. Submit this notebook containing your derivations to Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea in this exercise is to understand how a naive Bayes classifier and a hidden Markov model work, by implementing them yourself. Therefore, you should not use any libraries providing the models off-the-shelf. Also you should not copy-paste any solutions you might find on the Internet. Doing so you will risk losing the points for the exercise. You can, of course, compare the output of your implementation to any reference implementation."

    "**NB**: The exercise does not assume knowledge on molecular biology. The description shows one simplified use case for a hidden Markov model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central dogma of molecular biology (roughly) states that DNA is transcribed into RNA. The RNA is then translated into protein, and proteins perform most of the functions within the cell. A protein is composed of a string of amino acids. While there are about twenty commonly occuring amino acids, and they can be grouped many different ways, we will consider them all to belong to either the Aliphatic or Hydroxyl group (to simplify calculations). This sequence is called the primary structure of the protein. A key factor in understanding the function of a particular protein is its secondary structure, that is, how the amino acids behave in three dimensional space. For example, the following figure shows a cartoon rendering of the secondary structure of a protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](secondarystructure.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the figure suggests, two of the most important features of the seconary structure are $\\alpha$ helices and $\\beta$ sheets. However, it is difficult to assess the secondary structure without expensive experimental techniques such as crystallography. On the other hand, finding the sequence of amino acids in a protein sequence is inexpensive. Consequently, a goal of computational biology is to infer the secondary structure of a protein given its primary structure (the sequence of amino acids).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we conduct a set of costly crystallography experiments and discover the following secondary structures and associated amino acid sequences. $\\alpha$ means $\\alpha~\\text{helix}$, $\\beta$ means $\\beta~\\text{sheet}$, $\\mathtt{A}$ means aliphatic and $\\mathtt{H}$ means hydroxyl. For example, in the first protein (i.e., first row) the second $\\beta$ corresponds to the third $\\mathtt{A}$, because they are both in the third position."
