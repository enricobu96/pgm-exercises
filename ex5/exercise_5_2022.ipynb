    "Make sure the notebook produces correct results when ran sequentially starting from the first cell. You can ensure this by clearing all outputs, running all cells, and finally correcting any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get points:\n",
    "1. Submit your answers to the automatically checked Moodle test. \n",
    " - You have 5 tries on the test: the highest obtained score will be taken into account.\n",
    " - For numerical questions the tolerance is $1\\cdot10^{-4}$.\n",
    "2. Submit this notebook containing your derivations to Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises are designed such that you should be able to exercises 1-3 based on the structure learning lecture on Tuesday Feb 22nd and 4-6 based on the structure search lecture on Thursday Feb 24th.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the format specified in the week 2 exercises for returning the structure in Exercises 1 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally note that you do not have to fully implement the algorithms, you may implement parts and run the single instance as if you would run the algorithm on pen and paper. However, you do not get points if you get the correct result but by running a different algorithm."

Each local score is followed by the number of parents for the local score and the parent variables themselves. In the section for variable 0 the line `-193.80 0` thus corresponds to the local score $f(0, \\emptyset)$; the line `-193.42 2 1 2` corresponds to the local score $f(0, \\{ 1, 2\\})$, etc.\n",
