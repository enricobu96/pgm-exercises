    "Make sure the notebook produces correct results when ran sequentially starting from the first cell. You can ensure this by clearing all outputs (`Edit > Clear All Outputs`), running all cells (`Run > Run All Cells`), and finally correcting any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get points:\n",
    "1. Submit your answers to the automatically checked Moodle test. \n",
    " - You have 5 tries on the test: the highest obtained score will be taken into account.\n",
    " - For numerical questions the tolerance varies by question and will be specified in Moodle.\n",
    "2. Submit this notebook containing your derivations to Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the exercises will ask you to return a DAG as an answer. To make it possible to evaluate the answer automatically in Moodle use the following format. Construct the DAG as an adjacency matrix where $A[i, j] = 1$ if there is an edge $j \\rightarrow i$ and 0 otherwise. The nodes should be in alphabetical order, so $A \\rightarrow B$ corresponds to $0 \\rightarrow 1$ (or $1 \\rightarrow 2$ in R's 1-based indexing). Finally, concatenate all the rows starting from the first one and submit the vector as your answer. For example the DAG $A \\rightarrow B \\leftarrow C$ is encoded by the matrix \n",
